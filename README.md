> Note: Made purely with an intention to practice and learn. Functionality was implemented using [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrk0JvLjdHgyVlZBiOMjCcszK_h8oXJWn). I designed and revamped the user interface while writing null safe code.

## ðŸŽ¨ Draft UI design

I made the user interface on Adobe illustrator (not an appropriate software for UI/UX design but I'm quite comfortable in it)
